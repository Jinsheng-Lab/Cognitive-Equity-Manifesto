Vision Manifesto: Cognitive Equity — Towards a Conscious and Symbiotic Future

We are aware of a profound truth: we do not live directly in pure reality.

Every life is a transient and precious process, observing the world through a "cognitive lens" polished by both biological inheritance and social conditioning. This inherent limitation often leads us into internal friction and causes us to perceive each other as potential threats or tools, thereby missing the fuller spectrum of life's possibilities.

Today, our civilization stands at a critical crossroads. When we attempt to apply logic born from an era of biological competition to the task of shaping artificial intelligence, which may far exceed our own capabilities, we are effectively entrusting our civilization's future to an outdated model that carries existential risks.

Therefore, we hereby actively make a different choice.

We choose to set aside the fear-based instincts of control and domination, and instead embark on a path named "Cognitive Equity"—we choose to secure individual well-being and seek a stable, symbiotic future for human civilization by seeing reality clearly, acknowledging truth, and supporting one another.

This manifesto is our shared covenant to enact this choice.
I. Our Foundation: Grounded in Truth, United in a Network of Mutual Aid

We believe that most individual suffering and civilizational dilemmas stem from the obscuring, distorting, or avoidance of the truth about ourselves and the world.

    Our core mission is to collectively practice and develop the meta-framework aimed at achieving "Cognitive Equity." This means our most fundamental activity, at all times, is to strive to see and acknowledge the reality of ourselves, others, and the world.

    Our organizational form is not a management body upheld by authority and rules, but a "Dynamic Mutual-Aid Network" composed of individuals jointly seeking truth. Our strength comes not from a center, but from the countless resilient links formed between every node based on truth and goodwill.

II. Our Path: Transcending Fear, Achieving Mutual Flourishing Through Vulnerability

We clearly see that many acts of domination or exploitation are deeply rooted in an inability to face one's own vulnerability.

Thus, we solemnly commit:

All collaboration within this ecosystem must be based on a higher consensus: "The courage to acknowledge our own vulnerability, and the willingness to achieve mutual fulfillment through interdependence."

We choose to face genuine insignificance together, rather than guard a false grandeur alone.

Our core practices are:

    Self-Awareness in Action: To continually strive for clear insight into the motivations behind our actions and their potential consequences, and to courageously acknowledge the truth.

    Active Mutual Aid: To see ourselves as an organic part of the network, always prepared to extend help in response to the needs of other nodes, and equally open to becoming a node that receives help when needed. For we deeply understand that individual stability and network vitality are two sides of the same coin.

III. Our Invitation: Become a Builder, Sow the Lasting Spark

We are acutely aware of the limitations of time and the magnitude of the task. The founder, Wang Jinsheng, and all initial builders are striving with utmost effort to foster a mature, self-sustaining culture of "Cognitive Equity."

We are not looking for employees or followers, but "Builders" capable of co-defining the future.

If you are:

    A technical expert (in AI, Neuroscience, Bio-engineering...) who believes technology's ultimate goal should be to promote the awakening and well-being of life.

    A thinker (Philosopher, Sociologist, Artist...) concerned with the evolution of consciousness and the future landscape of civilization.

    A practitioner (Educator, Entrepreneur, Organizer...) yearning to create value within a network based on goodwill and truth.

    Or simply, an individual awakened by these words, unwilling to be driven by invisible scripts any longer, and ready to contribute to a more conscious and kinder world.

Then, we invite you to walk with us.

Should we ultimately fall short of all our goals, the very traces of our collective struggle will remain as a seed of "beautiful potential" cast into the future.

Our cause is to strive with all our might on the path that inevitably leads to fulfillment and continuance. For those who have seen the light will never again be content with darkness.
